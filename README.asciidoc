xebin - Atari XL/XE Binary File Utility
=======================================

// This file is in AsciiDoc format. It is the source for README.html.
:Compact-Option:

+xebin+ is a small command-line utility for manipulating atari binary (executable) files.
It can list contents of binary file, merge several files into a single loadable file,
or pack file in a way similar to Piotr Fusik's FlashPack.

+xebin+ is written in http://www.digitalmars.com/d/2.0/[D programming language] and tested
under Windows and Linux (x86). However, it should be possible to build and run it on any
platform, for which D compiler is available.
It is designed to be easily embeddable in build scripts.


Installation
------------

Both binary releases for Windows and sources for all platforms are available at http://github.com/epi/xebin[github].

To build +xebin+ from sources you need http://www.digitalmars.com/d/download.html[DMD 2.052] and a GNU compatible make.

Go to console window, and, depending on your operating system, type

--------------
> mingw32-make
--------------

or simply

--------------
$ make
--------------

After successful build, you can move file +xebin.exe+ or +xebin+ to a directory within your +PATH+.

If you like hacking, you can easily do without make, and you can use different D compiler.


Usage
-----

A general syntax is:

----------------------------
$ xebin command [options] [input_files]
----------------------------

You can place options wherever you wish in the command line, as well as join
single-letter options together, if they do not require parameters.

For all specific commands below you can skip input files specification.
In such case, +xebin+ will read from standard input.

Similarly, +xebin+ writes its output to standard output, but you can (and usually
you should) specify an output file name with +-o+ or +--output+ option.
When using +-v+ or +--verbose+ option, additional output is always written to
+stdout+.

You can see the list of available commands and options by typing:

----------------------------
$ xebin help
----------------------------

Listing binary file contents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

----------------------------
$ xebin l[ist] [input_files]
----------------------------

An example output:

-------------------------------------
D:\proj\tipview>xebin l tv10.xex
  0. 8C00-903C (043D)
  1. 91DD-A3B7 (11DB)
  2. Run 91FD
-------------------------------------

Merging two or more files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

----------------------------
$ xebin m[erge] [-o=fn] [-v] [input_files]
----------------------------

Blocks from all files are concatenated in the order they appear in the list
of input files.

Reduntant +FFFF+ headers are dropped. 

+-v+ displays layout of resulting file.

Extracting block from binary file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

----------------------------
$ xebin e[xtract] [-n=pos] [-r] [-o=fn] [-v] [input_files]
----------------------------

Default option is to extract first block of first input file, including its binary header.

Option +-n=pos+ or +--position=pos+ allows extracting other blocks.
Block numbering is continuous across all input files and starts from 0.
Only one block is extracted at a time.

Option +-r+ or +--raw+ strips header from extracted block.

+-v+ displays info about extracted block.

Compressing binary file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

----------------------------
$ xebin p[ack] [-a=ad] [-s] [-o=fn] [-v] [input_files]
----------------------------

The command compresses a binary file using FlashPack algorithm. For each group of
blocks between Init and Run blocks, it creates a single packed block with its own
depacker. Init and Run blocks are copied unchanged.

+xebin+ tries to determine address of packed block so it won't collide with
unpacked blocks. You can override its guess, or just give it a hand when it fails
to do so, by using +-a=ad+ or +--address=ad+ option. Address may be supplied
in decimal or hexadecimal (with +0x+ or +$+ prefix) notation. Address prefixed
with +-+ is treated as address of the last byte of packed block.

+-s+ or +--disable-os+ will cause the interrupts and OS ROM be disabled during depacking.
Apart from an unnoticeable speed-up, it allows for placing unpacked blocks in areas
of RAM normally hidden under OS ROM.

+-v+ displays layout of resulting file.

Unpacking binary file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+xebin+ can also unpack FlashPack-compressed files. It handles files created by
Piotr Fusik's FlashPack 1.0 or 2.1, or +xebin+ itself.

----------------------------
$ xebin u[npack] [-o=fn] [-v] [input_files]
----------------------------

+-v+ displays layout of resulting file.


History
-------

xebin 1.0.1 (2011-04-??)::

Command line options and parameters work according to description.
Support for hexadecimal address added.

Bugs
----

It is impossible to set different addresses for multiple input files in pack option,
as well as different settings for OS ROM and interrupts.
