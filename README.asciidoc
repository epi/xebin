xebin - Atari XL/XE Binary File Utility
=======================================

// This file is in AsciiDoc format. It is the source for README.html.
:Compact-Option:

xebin is a small command-line utility for manipulating atari binary (executable) files.
It can list contents of binary file, merge several files into a single loadable file,
or pack file in a way similar to Piotr Fusik's FlashPack.

xebin is written in http://www.digitalmars.com/d/2.0/[D programming language] and tested
under Windows and Linux (x86). However, it should be possible to build and run it on any
platform, for which D compiler is available.
It is designed to be easily embeddable in build scripts.

Installation
------------

You need http://xasm.atari.org[xasm] and http://www.digitalmars.com/d/download.html[DMD 2.047],
http://www.perl.org/get.html[Perl] and a GNU compatible make to build xebin.

Go to console window, and, depending on your operating system, type

--------------
> mingw32-make
--------------

or simply

--------------
$ make
--------------

If you like hacking, you can easily do without make, and you can use different D compiler
or even different assembler.

Usage
-----

TBD


Bugs
----

It is impossible to set different addresses for multiple input files in pack option,
as well as different settings for OS ROM and interrupts.
