xebin - Atari XL/XE Binary File Utility
=======================================

// This file is in AsciiDoc format. It is the source for README.html.
:Compact-Option:

xebin is a small command-line utility for manipulating atari binary (executable) files.
It can list contents of binary file, merge several files into a single loadable file,
or pack file in a way similar to Piotr Fusik's FlashPack.

xebin is written in http://www.digitalmars.com/d/2.0/[D programming language] and tested
under Windows and Linux (x86). However, it should be possible to build and run it on any
platform, for which D compiler is available.
It is designed to be easily embeddable in build scripts.

Usage
-----

TBD

Bugs
----

It is impossible to set different addresses for multiple input files in pack option,
as well as different settings for OS ROM and interrupts.
